# Movies Application
Sample Android application that loads movies data from a remote server, with offline caching mechanism.

## Used Technologies:
1. Kotlin
2. Clean Architecture with MVVM
3. Live Data & Data Binding
4. Koin as dependency injection
5. Repository Pattern
6. Kotlin Coroutines
7. Retrofit
8. Navigation.
9. Room.

## Possible Enhancements in the Future:
1. Inject logger utility class in order to add logs inside the layers of the architecture without breaking the testability of it.
2. Use Glide to load/cache mechanisms.

## Missing Features due to shortage of time:
1. Add unit testing by injecting mocked datasources to the repositories.
